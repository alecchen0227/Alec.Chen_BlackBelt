	Hello, my name is Alec Chen. I have been at Code Ninjas for a little more than 2 years, as I began my coding adventure in March 2022. 
	My three favourite things about being a ninja at code ninjas is the friendly community, the fun of coding, and learning a new language. Since my entry to code ninjas, all of my senseis have been exceptionally kind and caring to me as I progressed through the various phases of coding from Javascript, to Lua, and finally to C#. I find coding as a hobby of mine and everytime I come here, I am very excited to begin coding and progressing through the curriculum. I love to understand the code that I am writing and asking for help from senseis. Finally, coming to code ninjas isn't just for a hobby, but it is to learn something useful in life. Playing games can be a fun hobby, but it is more fun to understand the development of the games and learning how to build your own games through the creative mindset of humans. I enjoyed learning how my favourite Roblox games came to life beginning from the simple obbies and visit the more enhanced unity games using physics and camera angles. All in all, coming to code ninjas has always been a positive experience and I love being a ninja here.
	I have not created a name for my game yet, but as for now, it will be called Zombieland as a placeholder. 
	The main challenge that I believe will be a struggle for me as I begin my custom game for blackbelt is the projectiles, since my game will be a first person shooter game. Another challenge may be driving since I might implement vehicles for the player to drive. During code ninjas, I have not touched a driving game before, so maybe that can be a suggestion to add into the curiculum of red belt by replacing codey raceway with an actual car.
