After doing my first submission, I thought after so much feedback from ninjas to senseis, I would have a game that accommodates to most people's likings. The following week, I found out that there is always room for improvement for my game by understanding the feedback for my game. The first feedback was to change the larger enemy animation speed as it was on par with the smaller enemies making it look out of place. By changing it, it makes the game look more realistic. Another feedback that I found useful was to remove the money system. Initially having the money/score system as two separate parts, it was fun, but combining them together not only reduces redundancy but also creates a new gameplay style that makes the player have to use their points that they need to win with to obtain a new weapon. This gives the player a different challenge to approach other than just avoiding enemies. However, the most important feedback I received is for performance. It doesn't matter how high quality your game is; if your game lags and becomes slow for the majority of the playerbase, it can't even be played. Using this feedback to optimize my game now allows my game to run smoother and faster, making the endless mode more enjoyable performance wise. With good feedback there is always mediocre feedback. This one feedback that I didn't find useful for my game is to give the flashlight a special purpose. The game reviewer said that the flashlight doesn't serve any purpose other than being an accessory which is ideally the whole purpose of it. All of my maps are very dark and can hardly see through a couple metres which is why I implemented this flashlight to allow the player to see a few metres ahead rather than walking in the dark. Even though the flashlight has unlimited battery, I found it to be a good utility to use to maneuver the various maps. Overall, using this feedback for my game has both helped me and inspire me to think outside of the box for future games.
