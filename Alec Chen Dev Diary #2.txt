Having a planning phrase in every project should be mandatory as it gives creators ideas to brainstorm and implement when they are working on their game. I created a scene outline to connect my scenes whenever a button is pressed and it looks basically as it is in the game. I had a main menu that connected to start game, high score, credits, and controls. In the start game it is split between campaign and endless where in the campaign there is 3 levels. In the levels that are still on the menu, I implemented a back button so that the player can return to the previous scene they were in. Other than the scenes, I made a diagram of what I wanted my UI s to look like in the main menu and in the game, it looks basically the same except there are no abilities and a map that indicates where enemies are. Overall, I basically used all my ideas from the planning phase to begin my prototyping phase.
