Transitioning from alpha phase to beta phase helped increase make my game much better than it previously was. First off, I added animations to my enemies which helped make my game come to life. I edited my UI to make it look more visually appealing which helped make my game look better. I did this by adding outlines around my boxes. Another feature that made my game look better was swapping the arrays of health bars into an image with the fill feature which changes depending on my HP, making the game look more smooth. I changed the infinite sprinting into a sprint bar that decreases as the shift ar is held. This makes the game more balanced and not as easy as it used to be. Something unique that I added was a flashlight feature that will turn on by pressing F. This helps with playing in the darker maps. Speaking of light, I added a spotlight on my treasure chests which made it much easier to find the chest to swap guns. Lastly, I implemented sounds into my game. I putted piano music into the menu of the game and then windy noises when playing. When the player moves, footstep noises are created and when the enemies are close by, they will create roaring noises. Overall, by doing beta phase, I was able to accomplish and fine tune my game to my liking.
