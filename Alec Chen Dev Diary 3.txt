In my game, Bubble Beast Brawl, I was able to instantiate projectiles at a quick rate whenever the player inputs with the left mouse key. I used a couple methods to check the ammo count, inputs, and if reloading to make sure the game is working smoothly as it should. I also created a health box which can be dropped from an enemy in the game at a 10% rate using Random.Range(0, 10) whenever the player is below max hp. The prototype stage was a great way to help me develop my ideas that I wanted to implement into the game. Some feedback I received during prototype playtesting is to make the game have customizable mouse settings, digital feedback whenever the enemy is hit, recoil, and particle effects. I implemented a mouse setting in the settings scene by using a scroll bar and playerprefs so that the settings are kept throughout the game. Whenever the player shoots or reloads, I changed the rotation so that the player knows that they are shot or reloading. I added particle effects on my enemies whenever they are shot and a large effect whenever the enemy dies.
